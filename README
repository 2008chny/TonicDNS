PHP library/framework for building Web apps while respecting the 5 principles
of RESTful design.

 * Give every "thing" an ID (aka URIs)
 * Link things together (HATEOAS)
 * Use standard methods (aka the standard interface)
 * Resources with multiple representations (aka standard document formats)
 * Communicate statelessly

See http://peej.github.com/tonic/ for more info.


How it works
------------

Everything is a resource, and a resource is defined as a PHP class. An annotation
wires a URI (or a collection of URIs) to the resource, and methods that match
the HTTP methods by name allow interaction with it.


/**
 * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
 * @uri /example
 */
class ExampleResource extends Resource { }


The incoming HTTP request is turned into a list of negotiated URIs based on the
accept request headers which can then be used to pick the best representation
for the response.


/**
 * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
 * @uri /example
 */
class ExampleResource extends Resource {
    
    function get($request) {
        
        $response = new Response($request);
        
        $response->code = Response::OK;
        $response->body = 'Example response';
        
        return $response;
        
    }
  
}


How to get started
------------------

The best place to get started is to get the hello world example running on your
system, to do this you will need a web server running PHP4+.

Place all of the Tonic files into your PHP include path so that other scripts can
find it. By default on Windows this will probably be in "c:\php\includes\tonic" or
on Linux/Unix it will be "/usr/share/php/tonic"

Copy "docroot/dispatch.php" into your servers document root and edit it so that the
require_once statement paths point to the Tonic library and the examples.

Finally you need to route all incoming requests to dispatch.php. How you do this
depends on your web server. If you are using Apache, the simplest way is to copy
the .htaccess file from "docroot/.htaccess" into your Apache document root.


For more information, read the code. Start with the dispatcher "docroot/dispatch.php"
and then the examples in the "examples" directory.
